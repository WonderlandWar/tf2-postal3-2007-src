TF2 Postal 3
==
This is repo contains TF2 ported to the Source 2007 SDK with reverse engineered TF2 Postal 3 code from the Postal 3 leak.

Note: This repo isn't properly setup for anyone to compile yet and I'm still trying to figure that out.
I also want this to be compileable with Visual Studio 2013 or Visual Studio 2022 because as it is right now, it needs Visual Studio 2005.
